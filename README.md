# webhook-sender

A website that allows you to send custom text to Discord webhooks. 

## Usage

* Go to any server in which you have the permission to manage webhooks,
* Navigate to `Server settings` => `Integrations` => `Webhooks` and copy the `Webhook-URL`. (This URL should look something like this: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/833791921596875635/Y4YTqZ1pOY5mcRU8jp-kaEVcM2RaNCDyd2GGzo2bWIMuZGcjla`,)
* Next, open [the web-interface](https://jcw05.ml/webhook-sender) and paste your webhook-URl into the first field (`Webhook-URL`).
* In the second field (`Message`), type whatever you want to send to your Discord channel.
* If you want to, you can also enter a specific username for the webhook and set a profile picture. These fields are optional though!
* After you entered all data, click on the `send` button. You should see your message appearing within a second.
